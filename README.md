## Task-1 Amazon Sales Analysis
This repository contains a data-driven analysis of Amazon sales using Python to visualize key insights.

# üìå Task Overview
Exploring the Amazon Sales Dataset follows a structured approach. We begin by cleaning and preparing the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. After that, we use descriptive statistics to summarize the data, calculating values such as averages and ranges. Next, we create visualizations like charts and graphs to identify patterns and relationships within the data. We also look for outliers‚Äîdata points that deviate significantly from the norm‚Äîand test any hypotheses we may have. To gain deeper insights, we group the data into relevant categories.

## Task-2-Social Media Sentiment Analysis

# üìå Task Overview
Welcome to the "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" project! This data science project focuses on analyzing and predicting the sentiment of tweets using machine-learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights into public opinion and sentiment trends on Twitter.


---
### Project Description

Twitter sentiment analysis is a crucial task for understanding public opinion and sentiment towards various topics, brands, or events. This project utilizes machine-learning models to classify tweets based on their sentiment polarity, helping businesses, researchers, and individuals gauge public sentiment effectively.


---
### Features
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing: Removes stopwords, applies stemming, and cleans text
- ‚úÖ Machine Learning Model: Uses a trained Logistic Regression model 
- ‚úÖ User-Friendly UI: Built with Streamlit for easy tweet sentiment prediction


---
### Models Used

Three different models have been employed in this project for sentiment analysis:

1. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier:**
   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that assumes features are independent binary variables. It's commonly used for text classification tasks.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It's effective for text classification tasks with non-linear decision boundaries.

3. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Logistic Regression is a classic classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome. It's widely used for text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.


---
### Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the sentiment analysis models was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the classification.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC Score:** Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
