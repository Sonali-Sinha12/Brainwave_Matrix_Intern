# Task-1 Amazon Sales Analysis
This repository contains a data-driven analysis of Amazon sales using Python to visualize key insights.
# 📌 Task Overview
Exploring the Amazon Sales Dataset follows a structured approach. We begin by cleaning and preparing the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. After that, we use descriptive statistics to summarize the data, calculating values such as averages and ranges. Next, we create visualizations like charts and graphs to identify patterns and relationships within the data. We also look for outliers—data points that deviate significantly from the norm—and test any hypotheses we may have. To gain deeper insights, we group the data into relevant categories.
# Images Overview:
• Missing values

•	Missing values percentage

•	Scatter plot

•	Histogram

•	Heatmap

•	Correlation matrix(Pearson)

•	Correlation matrix(Spearson)
